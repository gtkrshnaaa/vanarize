# Vanarize

Vanarize is a high-performance, statically-typed, procedural language that utilizes a **Direct-to-Machine-Code JIT (Just-In-Time)** compilation strategy. Unlike traditional interpreters or bytecode VMs, Vanarize eliminates the "fetch-decode-execute" loop overhead by emitting executable machine instructions into memory immediately upon parsing.
